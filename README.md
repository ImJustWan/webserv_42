# Webserv

## Description 

This project will require you to write your own HTTP server. You'll have to follow the HTTP RFC, so you'll be able to test with a real web browser. HTTP is one of the most widely used protocols on the Internet.
Knowing how it works will be more than useful, even if you don't end up doing any web work.
